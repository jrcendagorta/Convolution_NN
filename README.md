Convolution Neural Network for CIFAR-10 data (Image recognition)

This juptyer notebook includes an implementation for a simple convolutional nueral network
trained on the CIFAR-10 data containing 10 different image classes. 

The current success rate is just under 86% and will be further developed to improve the error.
