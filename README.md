Convolution Neural Network for CIFAR-10 data (Image recognition)

This juptyer notebook includes an implementation for a convolutional nueral network
trained on the CIFAR-10 data containing 10 different image classes. 

The current NN achitecture contains 6 convolution layers, 3 pooling layers follwed by 
a feed forward network consisting of 2 hidden layers.
